There are 4 questions to ask when designing your database schema.
1) What fields or colums does our table need?
2) What should the identifying column (primary key) be? ( Required for each table. Usually id but it can be anything provided it is different for every entry)
3) What type of data do we expect for each column?
4) Are there any restrictions needed for each column? (Value above 0, required, min-max length. etc.)
